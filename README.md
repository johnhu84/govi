Govi exercise
installation steps:
1. run "%npm install"
2. run "%node index.js"
  -this will start the CLI tool script where you can type 4 different commands (or their numeric equivalents [1-4]) or "exit" to exit the script

*For piping, use desired command in third argument when starting index.js, for example, in Windows 10 PowerShell
%node index.js 'goviquery ''invoices'' -s ""paidDate"" -d ""ASC""'
